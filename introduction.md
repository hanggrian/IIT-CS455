# Introduction

## Data communications

### Data flow

| Flow | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Simplex | The communication is uni-directional. |
| Half-duplex | Each station can both transmit and decode, but not at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive and vice-versa. |
| Full-duplex | Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. |

## Networks

A **network** is a set of devices connected by communication links. A device can
be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receing data
generated by other devices in the network.

### Connection types

| Connection | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Point-to-point | Provides a dedicated link between two devices. The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two devices. |
| Multipoint | A connection in which more than two devices share a single link. |

### Category of topology

The **topology** of a network is the geometric representation of the
relationship of the links and devices to one another.

| Topology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img width="240" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/computer-network-topologies-mesh-topology.png"> | Every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device. The term dedicated link carries trafffic only between the two devices it connects. |
| <img width="240" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/computer-network-topologies-star-topology.png"> | Each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller (usually called a hub). The devices are not directly linked to one another. |
| <img width="240" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/computer-network-topologies-bus-topology.png"> | One long acts as a backbone to link all the devices in a network. |
| <img width="240" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/computer-network-topologies-ring-topology.png"> | A signal is passed along the ring in one direction from device to device until it reaches its destination. Each device is linked only to each immediate neighbors. |

#### Mesh topology equation

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
  w & = & \displaystyle \frac{n.(n-1)}{2} \\\\
  \sf WAN\ links & = & \sf \frac{sites.(sites-1)}{2}
\end{array}
$$

### Types of area

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Local Area Network (LAN) | Usually privately owned and linked the devices in a single office, building, or campus. |
| Wide Area Network (WAN) | Provides long distance transmission of data, image, audio, and video information of a larger geographical areas. |

## Internet

Hunders of thousands of interconnected networks.

### History

| Year | What happened |
| --- | --- |
| 1962 | Memos written at MIT in the 1962 discussing the "galactic network" concept (globally interconnected set of computers everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site). |
| 1961, 1964 | The first paper and the first book published on *Packet Switching* by *Leonard Kleinrock* at MIT. |
| 1965 | *TX-2* computer in MIT & *Q-32* in California were connected with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first wide-area computer network. |
| 1966-1967 | The computer network concept was developed and the plan for the *ARPANET* was put together. |
| 1967 | Each host computer would be atttached to a specialized computer called an *Interface Message Processor (IMP)*. The IMPs would be connected to one another. |
| 1969 | 4 nodes at UCLA, UCSD, Stanford Research Instritute, and University of Utah connected via IMPs to form a network. |
| 1972 | Email software presentation at International Computer Communication Conference. |
| 1974 | *Cerf and Kahn* published the paper *A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication*. |
| 1983 | TCP/IP becomes standard. |
| 1989 | Dial-up internet access. |
| 1991 | *World Wide Web (WWW)*. |

### ISP

The national *Internet Service Providers (ISP)* are backbone networks created
and maintained by specialized companies. To provide connectivity between end
users, these backbone networks are connected by complex switching stations
called *Network Access Points (NAPs)*.

| Coverage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Regional | Smaller ISPs that are connected to one or more national ISPs. |
| Local | Provide direct service to the end users. They can be connected to regional ISPs or directly to national ISPs. |
