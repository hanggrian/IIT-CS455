# Networks

A **network** is a set of devices connected by communication links. A device can
be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receing data
generated by other devices in the network.

## Data flow

| Flow | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Simplex | The communication is uni-directional. |
| Half-duplex | Each station can both transmit and decode, but not at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive and vice-versa. |
| Full-duplex | Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. |

## Types of connection

| Connection | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Point-to-point | Provides a dedicated link between two devices. The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two devices. |
| Multipoint | A connection in which more than two devices share a single link. |

## Category of topology

The **topology** of a network is the geometric representation of the
relationship of the links and devices to one another.

| Topology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img width="240" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/computer-network-topologies-mesh-topology.png"> | Every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device. The term dedicated link carries trafffic only between the two devices it connects. |
| <img width="240" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/computer-network-topologies-star-topology.png"> | Each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller (usually called a hub). The devices are not directly linked to one another. |

Each device is linked only to each immediate neighbors. |

### Mesh topology equation

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
  w & = & \displaystyle \frac{n.(n-1)}{2} \\
  \sf WAN \ links & = & \sf \frac{sites.(sites-1)}{2}
\end{array}
$$

## Types of area

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Local Area Network (LAN) | Usually privately owned and linked the devices in a single office, building, or campus. |
| Wide Area Network (WAN) | Provides long distance transmission of data, image, audio, and video information of a larger geographical areas. |
