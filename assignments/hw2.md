# [Homework 2](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS455/blob/assets/assignments/hw2.pdf)

## Problem 1

> What is the carrier signal? Explain its role in the analog transmission.

## Problem 2

> Consider a low-pass channel with the carrier frequency of $15$ kHz. What is
  the BASK bit rate if $d=0.5$?

## Problem 3

> Calculate the baud rate for the given bit rate and type of modulation:
>
> - $3000$ bps, BFSK
> - $50$ kbps, BASK
> - $60$ kbps, 16-QAM
> - $9000$ bps, QPSK

## Problem 4

> The constellation diagram has two points whose coordinates are $(2,0)$
  and $(8,0)$. What modulation does this diagram present? What is the
  interpretation of these coordinates?

## Problem 5

> How is a channel related to a link?

## Problem 6

> How is a channel related to a link?

## Problem 7

> We would like to digitize a certain analog signal using $5$ bits per sample.
  The lowest frequency of this signal is $100$ kHz and its bandwidth is $200$
  kHz. What is the bit rate?

## Problem 8

> Can packets in a datagram network arrive at their destination out of order? If
  so, why?

## Problem 9

> What are the basic differences between circuit switching and datagram
  switching?

## Problem 10

> Explain the function of a dial-up modem.

## Problem 11

> The FHSS technique with $16$ different carrier frequencies is used to create a
  communication channel for a certain sender-receiver pair. The resulting
  expanded bandwidth is $B1$. We have to increase the number of the
  sender-receiver pairs from $1$ to $8$. What is the resulting expanded
  bandwidth $B2$?

## Problem 12

> Explain why ADSL is asymmetric.
