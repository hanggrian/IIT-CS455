# Internet

Hunders of thousands of interconnected networks.

## History

| Year | What happened |
| --- | --- |
| 1962 | Memos written at MIT in the 1962 discussing the "galactic network" concept (globally interconnected set of computers everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site). |
| 1961, 1964 | The first paper and the first book published on *Packet Switching* by *Leonard Kleinrock* at MIT. |
| 1965 | *TX-2* computer in MIT & *Q-32* in California were connected with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first wide-area computer network. |
| 1966-1967 | The computer network concept was developed and the plan for the *ARPANET* was put together. |
| 1967 | Each host computer would be atttached to a specialized computer called an *Interface Message Processor (IMP)*. The IMPs would be connected to one another. |
| 1969 | 4 nodes at UCLA, UCSD, Stanford Research Instritute, and University of Utah connected via IMPs to form a network. |
| 1972 | Email software presentation at International Computer Communication Conference. |
| 1974 | *Cerf and Kahn* published the paper *A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication*. |
| 1983 | TCP/IP becomes standard. |
| 1989 | Dial-up internet access. |
| 1991 | *World Wide Web (WWW)*. |

## ISP

The national *Internet Service Providers (ISP)* are backbone networks created
and maintained by specialized companies. To provide connectivity between end
users, these backbone networks are connected by complex switching stations
called *Network Access Points (NAPs)*.

| Coverage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Regional | Smaller ISPs that are connected to one or more national ISPs. |
| Local | Provide direct service to the end users. They can be connected to regional ISPs or directly to national ISPs. |

## Layers

The internet model sometimes called the TCP/IP protocol suite is composed of
five ordered layers. In developing the model, the designers distilled the
process of transmitting data to the most fundamental elements, identified the
networking functions and collected those functions into discrete groups that
became the layers. Each layer defines a family of functions distinct from those
of other layers.

Each layers calls upon the services of the layer just below it. Layer 3, for
example, uses the servies provided by layer 2 and provides the services for
layer 4.

| Layer | Duties |
| --- | --- |
| Application | E-mail, web browsing, file transfer. |
| Transport | Port addressing, segmentation and reassembly, connection control, flow control, error control. |
| Network | Logical addressing, routing, internetworking, packetizing, fragmentation, address resolution. |
| Data link | Framing, physical addressing, flow control, error control, access control. |
| Physical | Physical characteristics of interfaces and media, representation of bits, data rate, synchronization of bits. |

## OSI

*The Open System Interconnection (OSI)* model was designed by the international
organization for standardization. The OSI model is a theoretical model designed
to show how a protocol stack should be implemented.

| Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Session | Establishes sessions between communicating applications on the communicating computers (devices). |
| Presentation | Translates data to a standard format, manages encryption and data compression. |
